A simple plugin for WordPress that adds an unobtrusive "back to top" link to your site or blog.

== Description ==
A simple plugin for WordPress that adds an unobtrusive "back to top" link to your site or blog. The link uses WordPress' included jQuery to provide a slick UX, with the link subtly appearing after the page has been scrolled, and disappearing once the user returns to the top of the page. Additionally, a smooth scrolling animation is added when the link is clicked on.

== Installation ==
* Upload plugin files to your plugins folder, `/wp-content/plugins/`, or install using WordPress' "Add Plugin" feature â€” just search for "**ToTop Link**"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where can I see a demo of this in action? =
Check out the [plugin's page](http://www.daobydesign.com/free-plugins/totop-link-for-wordpress/)

= I've enabled the plugin, why isn't it displaying? =
It could be that your theme doesn't call wp_footer() (as it should). This is a pretty essential part of a WordPress theme, so we recommend you contact the theme's designer and ask them to add it. Optionally, if you're comfortable editing your theme file, you can [add it yourself](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_footer).
