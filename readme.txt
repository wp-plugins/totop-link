== Description ==
A simple plugin for WordPress that adds an unobtrusive "back to top" link to your site or blog. The link uses WordPress' included jQuery to provide a slick UX, with the link subtly appearing after the page has been scrolled, and disappearing once the user returns to the top of the page. Additionally, a smooth scrolling animation is added when the link is clicked on.
